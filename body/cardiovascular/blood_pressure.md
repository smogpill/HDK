- Might be entirely linked to metabolic syndrom [1][48]
- Might be linked to insulin resistance [1]
- Medication better taken at night [2][3]
- Drinking water seems to decrease systolic but not diastolic [8]
- Some probiotics could lower pressure [13]
- Isometric exercises seem surprisingly great at reducing diastolic [12]

# Target
- Target should be 120/80 or lower instead of 140/90 [17][18][24]

# Diet/supplements

## Good
- Olive oil may have a significant benefit [15]
- "Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil and flaxseeds (a source of the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA) may help to reduce blood pressure." [15]
- Olive leaf extract may help to reduce blood pressure [15]
- "Short-term studies have found that vitamin C may modestly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure" [15]
- Certain probiotic strains may modestly lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure [15]
- Nattokinase has been shown to modestly reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure [15]
- "Cinnamon may reduce blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes." [15]
- "Curcumin has been found to lower systolic, but not diastolic blood pressure, in postmenopausal women and people with lupus who have kidney inflammation" [15]
- "Garlic supplements may reduce systolic, but not diastolic, blood pressure in men and women who take anti-hypertensive medications but whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled." [15]
- "A low-dose of vitamin B-2 (riboflavin) may reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure in people with a certain genetic type (MTHFR 677TT), which can predispose to high blood pressure." [15]
- "Results from one clinical study in men and women with metabolic syndrome suggests that berberine, a compound found in plants such as barberry, Oregon grape and goldenseal, may lower systolic blood pressure." [15]
- "Hawthorn extract made from the leaves and flowers may modestly lower blood pressure, although more studies are needed to confirm. The blood pressure-lowering effect is attributed to flavonoid constituents (including quercetin)" [15]
- "Potassium is an important electrolyte which helps maintain blood pressure." However some high blood pressure medication can cause high potassium, so consulting with a physician is required [15][46]
- "Acetyl-L-carnitine, taken alone or with alpha-lipoic acid, may modestly lower systolic blood pressure in people with high blood pressure, but it does not seem to lower diastolic blood pressure in most people (McMackin, J Clin Hypertens 2007; Ruggenenti, Hypertension 2009; Parvanova, J Endocr Soc 2018)." [15]
- "Taurine supplementation appears to lower blood pressure in people with prehypertension, but it may take about 3 months for any benefit." [15]
- "L-Theanine may lessen blood pressure increases associated with caffeine use." [15]
- "Getting adequate niacin from foods has been associated with a decreased risk of developing high blood pressure, although getting too much niacin from foods may increase the risk" [15]
- "Hibiscus, taken in the form of capsules or tea, may reduce systolic blood pressure by about 7 mmHg compared to control (e.g., placebo, other teas or diet), but it does not appear to significantly lower diastolic blood pressure. Hibiscus may have the greatest benefit when taken in daily doses of more than 1 gram of dried flower and when used for more than 4 weeks, although more studies are needed to confirm (Ellis, Nutr Rev 2022). Hibiscus may lower blood pressure by a mechanism similar to ACE-inhibitors (Nwachukwu, Indian J Pharmacol 2015)." [15][49]. Avoid drinking alongside an ARB treatment!
- Breathing exercises [48] 
- Training grip strength [48]
- Beetroot supplements [49] (to avoid sugar from beets)
- Blueberries [49]
- Pomegranate extract [49] (to avoid sugar from pomegranate). Avoid drinking alongside an ARB treatment.
- Hawthorn extract seems like a magic thing that does plenty of good [49]

## Unclear
- "While low blood levels of vitamin D are associated with elevated blood pressure, a comprehensive review of 46 clinical trials concluded taking a vitamin D supplement was ineffective for lowering blood pressure, regardless of starting levels of vitamin D in the blood." [15]
- "There is mixed evidence that cocoa and chocolate may cause modest reductions in blood pressure, with some studies finding a benefit and others finding no effect on blood pressure at all." [15]
- "Evidence that pomegranate juice and resveratrol may lower blood pressure is inconsistent -- although one study did find resveratrol to significantly lower systolic blood pressure people with type 2 diabetes." [15]
- "Preliminary evidence suggests ashwagandha and black cohosh could potentially lower blood pressure. Although there is not enough evidence to take these supplements for this use, take with caution if you are already taking blood-pressure lowering medications." [15]
- "CBD (cannabidiol) oil can cause a modest drop in blood pressure in people taking high doses, although there do not appear to be clinical studies specifically investigating its effects in people with high blood pressure." [15]
- "Having low or deficient levels of magnesium may elevate blood pressure, although magnesium supplementation in people with high blood pressure appears to have, at best, a very modest benefit." [15]
- "Although some studies have found CoQ10 to lower high blood pressure, a critical review of these studies concluded that overall, CoQ10 does not have a significant effect on lowering blood pressure." [15]
- "Research suggests that L-arginine may modestly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in people with high blood pressure, but more research is needed to confirm." [15]

## Bad
- Potassium for ACE inhibitors [15][16]
- "The probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Brewer's yeast) may cause dangerously high blood pressure if taken with certain medications." [15]
- "Despite the fact that melatonin has been reported to decrease blood pressure in healthy people without hypertension, it may increase blood pressure in people taking antihypertensive medications." [15]
- "Whole licorice, which contains a substance called glycyrrhizin, can increase blood pressure. However, licorice from which this substance has been removed, called deglycyrrhizinated licorice (DGL), is not believed to increase blood pressure and is available as a supplement." [15]
- "Maca and hoodia may increase blood pressure." [15]
- "St. John's wort can cause high or unstable blood pressure." [15]
- "Green tea may reduce the effectiveness of certain beta-blocker drugs used to lower blood pressure." [15]
- "Use arginine cautiously if taking lisinopril." [16]
- "Green tea extract has been shown to significantly reduce the absorption of lisinopril, which might reduce its blood pressure-lowering effects. It is unclear if green tea has this effect, or if green tea or green tea extract affects the absorption of other ACE inhibitors, but to be on the safe side, it seems best to take green tea or green tea extract and lisinopril at different times of day." [16]
- "Be aware that lisinopril and other ACE inhibitors may deplete zinc levels in the body and increase the risk of zinc deficiency" [16]
- More drugs against HBP could cause kidney damage (either kidney specific drugs, but maybe even with multi-drugs) [45]
- Avoid mixing an ACE and and ARB at the same time (for example hibiscus + garlic)
