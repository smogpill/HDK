Retinol is a retinoid

# Pros
- Improves wrinkles
- Seems to be highly effective against severe forms of psoriasis [7]

# Cons

- Seems to be unsure if it does not age the skin long term [2][3][4]
- Can damage glands leading to dry eyes [5][6]
- Not to be applied on the same day as AHA (source is Dr Brad Standfield's discord).
