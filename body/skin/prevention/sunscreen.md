# Safe compounds
- "Sodium benzoate is added to skincare products (as well as food) to extend the shelf life of products. It does not carry the risks of benzene -- although benzene is part of its molecular structure. We are not aware of safety concerns associated with sodium benzoate in sunscreens." [2]

# Dangerous compounds
- Octocrylene can transform into Benzophenone with time [2][4][5]
- "Scientists have discovered at least two different compounds in sunscreens that are carcinogens — benzene and benzophenone. Neither of these compounds appear on product labels but may be introduced during product manufacture and/or created by chemical reactions with the sunscreen itself, with more produced over the life of the product!"
- "certain ingredients in sunscreens appear to make a product more likely to contain benzene and/or benzophenone." [2]
- "We don't know the source of the benzene for certain, but it is likely to have arisen from other ingredients such as butane, isobutane, or propane, which are propellants in aerosol sprays." [2]
- benzene (carcinogen, blood cancer) /!\ Does not appear on product labels [2][3]
- benzophenone (carcinogen) /!\ Does not appear on product labels [2][3]
