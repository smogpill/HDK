# Cons
- The amount of selenium in brazil nuts can be considerably different depending on individual nuts or geographical regions. [2]
- High selenium intake can be toxic (limit is 400 mcg/day). "This could easily be exceeded by a high intake of Brazil nuts particularly if combined with selenium supplements." [2]
