# Pros
- "A large study in Japan that followed 18,609 men and women aged 40 to 79 (average age 53) for 19 years, found no association between coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular death were found among those with normal blood pressure or moderately high blood pressure (140 to 159 mmHg systolic and 90 to 99 mmHg diastolic), but among people with very high blood pressure (160/100 mmHg or higher), drinking two or more cups of coffee per day was associated with double the risk of dying from heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular-related death compared to not drinking any coffee" [2][3]
- "A small study in Brazil among men and women on medication to treat high blood pressure (average blood pressure of 150/75 mmHg) found that drinking caffeinated coffee (6 oz. containing 135 mg of caffeine) did not significantly raise blood pressure compared to drinking decaffeinated coffee (5 oz. containing 5 mg of caffeine) or placebo (water)" [2][4]
- Reduced risk of colorectal cancer and all-cause mortality [7]
- Reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality for sedentary people [8]

# Cons
- "Be aware that caffeinated coffee intake, particularly among light caffeine users, may increase arterial stiffness for one to two hours after intake, and the effect is increased with smoking" [2][5]
- "Unfiltered coffee contains cafestol and kahweol, two cholesterol-raising chemicals found in coffee beans, while coffee filtered through a paper filter (including disposable K-Cups) contains only very small amounts of these constituents. The amount of cafestol and kahweol found in instant coffee is similar to the amount found in paper-filtered coffee (Urgert, J Agric Food Chem 1995), although, as noted above, instant coffee is not associated with the benefits that have been linked with moderate intake of brewed coffee." [2]
- "Due to its cafestol and kahweol content, unfiltered coffee — including French press coffee, Turkish coffee, espresso, mocha, moka pot coffee, or coffee prepared using a metal strainer rather than a paper filter — may increase cholesterol or triglyceride levels (Urgert, J Agric Food Chem 1995; van Dam, N Engl J Med 2020). It is unlikely that the use of coffee additives (i.e., milk, creamer or sugar) is responsible for this association, as most of the reviewed studies controlled additive use." [2]
