- Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), choline, L-carnitine. They abundant in animal-derived products and are processed by gut bacteria into TMA [4]
- TMA is a precursor to TMAO [4]
- TMAO is converted into TMAO by the liver [4]

# Solution
- "Foods commonly found in the Mediterranean diet such as cold-pressed olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and
red wine are rich in the compound DMB (or 3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol), which has been shown to inhibit TMAO
production3" [4][5]

# Cons
- Increases risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality [1][2][3]
