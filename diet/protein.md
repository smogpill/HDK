# Pros
- The gut can generate CCHa1 when eating a protein-rich diet which helps deep sleep [1]

# Cons
- Hyperprotein diet can damage kidneys if there is ground for kidney problems (hypertension, various kidney diseases, etc.)[2]
- Activates mTORC1 [7]
- Proteins might be healthspan vs lifespan. More proteins = healthspan, less proteins = lifespan [5][6][7]
