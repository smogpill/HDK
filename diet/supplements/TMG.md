Also known as: trimethylglycine

# Pros
- Might reduce the side effects of niacin on methyl pools [1]
- "You do need enough folate and B12 for for the different cycles, so youâ€™ve got the folate cycle, for example. In terms of actually giving your body methyl groups, TMG is a very efficient way of doing it." - Dr Brad Stanfield [1]
