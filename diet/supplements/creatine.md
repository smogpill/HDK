# Cons
- Concerns when taking creating supplements for people who have already high blood pressure. "Dr. Sonpal explains why creatine and blood pressure don't mix in some people: "Creatine makes your kidneys work harder, so there is a risk that it may cause your blood pressure to rise and/or worsen. The data is still conflicting as to a true link." But, to be safe, he says, "the best thing to do is avoid this supplement if you have hypertension.""[3]
- Concerns about kidneys because of creatinine, though for now it seems that creatinine remains at safe levels [4]
- Should increase water intake to avoid issues with kidneys. (Sources required)
