# Posology
- "For vitamin B12, we've opted for a 1200mcg dose - 50,000% of the RDA(7). While this might initially seem considerable, it's based on the understanding that oral absorption and bioavailability of B12 are less than optimal. In clinical medicine, B12 is often given via injections to rectify deficiencies, owing to this reason(8). Our higher dosage ensures an adequate amount of this essential vitamin can be absorbed and utilized by your body." [1]
