- "The trouble with NRH is that it’s very unstable. Trying to supplement it is nigh on impossible, because by the time you try and supplement it, it would have broken down into something else. It’s interesting, but be aware that the NMNH has converted into NRH, and then gets into the cell, but it doesn’t really matter because it’s unstable. So, whether it’s actually going to have any clinical use is unlikely." [1]
