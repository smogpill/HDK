# Pros
- "they don’t cause flushing" [1]
- "they don’t cause increases in homocysteine levels" [1]
- "they draw on the methyl pool less compared to niacin" [1]
- "they don’t cause increases in blood sugar levels" [1]
- "seem to boost NAD more compared to nicotinic acid" [1]
- "There was a study that was published showing that in people that needed hospital treatment from COVID-19, if you gave them nicotinamide riboside as well as a couple of other molecules, and you compared that to placebo, the NR group, they recovered three days faster." [1]
