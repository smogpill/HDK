### Rotation oscillation
- "The greatest body of evidence was for rotation oscillation brushes" [2]
- "Notably, only the oscillating rotating power toothbrush was able to consistently provide statistically significant benefit over manual toothbrushes in the 2014 Cochrane Review" [1][2]
- "More recent evidence also supports this as new studies suggest that oscillating rotating toothbrushes are more effective than high frequency sonic power toothbrushes." [1]
