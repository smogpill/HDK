Marker of inflammation

# Pros
- "Measuring CRP in otherwise healthy people, generally CRP goes up as we age, and this is quote-unquote inflammaging, where you’ve got all this inflammation that’s happening in the body, but you’re not fighting an infection at that point. That’s definitely an area that may bear fruit in trying to extend healthspan, but measuring CRP and trying to use that to correlate with heart attacks, again, that’s not something that’s typically done in clinical practice." - Dr Brad Stanfield [1]
