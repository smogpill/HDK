# Pros
- "they don’t cause flushing" [2]
- "they don’t cause increases in homocysteine levels" [2]
- "they draw on the methyl pool less compared to niacin" [2]
- "they don’t cause increases in blood sugar levels" [2]
- "seem to boost NAD more compared to nicotinic acid" [2]

# Cons?
- Nerve damage? [3][4]
