Other names: Nicotinic Acid, NA

# Posology
- Instant-release is safest version over sustained/slow release versions [2]
- "That’s the latest data that we’ve gotten; personally, for me, I can’t tolerate more than 100 milligrams of nicotinic acid. I only take a very small amount because I get very flushed, and I find that it burns if I take more than 100 milligrams. That’s as much as I can take." - Dr Brad Stanfield [2]
- "From the human data, there’s good evidence showing that if you take niacin, it boosts a molecule called homocysteine, which can be indirectly used as the amount of methyl groups that the body has available. Very indirectly, it’s not a particularly good measure, but homocysteine levels do go up. What that may indicate is that taking niacin is drawing from the methyl group or methyl pools that that the body’s got available.
How much of that actually corresponds to human health is very much up to debate, but while we’re in the infancy of all this, starting to find things out, personally, I don’t want to risk drawing away from my methyl pool. There’s different molecules called methyl donors; trimethylglycine (TMG) is one of them. By taking that, you essentially give your body methyl groups, and it just means that you’re not potentially opening yourself up to the negative effects of nicotinic acid.
It’s theoretical; there’s not a huge amount of data behind it. TMG, as I said, is a safe molecule, we know a lot about it, and there doesn’t really seem to be a downside about taking a small dose of TMG while we wait for more data to come through." - Dr Brad Stanfield [2]

# Pros
- Improves healthspan [2]

# Cons
- Hepatotoxicity [1]
- Does not improve lifespan [2]
- Can deplete methyl pools [2] -> taking TMG might solve the issue
