- "There is, and I’m gonna be a bit contentious here and say that I’m actually not a huge fan of senolytics. I think there are other solutions. The best solution, and I’ve spoken to other researchers about it, they seem to think that if we can actually rejuvenate the immune system itself, the immune system knows how to deal with them anyway."

# Cons

- Hunting for senescent cells might break muscle fibers and pull down the entire muscle fiber with it, which are hard to replace [3]
