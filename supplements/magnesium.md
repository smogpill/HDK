# Pros
- Magnesium taurate protects against damage:
-- Heart [1]
-- Brain [2]
-- Vision [3]
- Magnesium regulates muscle contraction and maintains electrolyte balance in the body's tissues. [4]
- Involved in bone development and the breakdown of sugars, fats, and protein [5]
- Low magnesium levels are associated with:
-- Heart disease
-- Type 2 diabetes
-- Neurological (brain) problems [6]
- Both magnesium and taurine decrease calcium and sodium levels in the body's cells. [7]
- They've both been shown to lower blood pressure and help prevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and blood clots. [8]
