# Pros
- Improves high intensity performance (less than 3 min) [17]
- Improves recovery [17]
- Might Enhance memory [17]
- Poses no adverse health risks [17]
- Decreasese uric acid. [17]
- No evidence of baldness inducing [17]
- No evidence of impact on DHT [17]
- No evidence on kidneys dysfunction [17][29]
- No evidence of muscle cramping [17]
- No evidence of dehydration [17]
- Seems safe regarding liver but still unclear [27] (see [26] for counterpoint)

# Cons
- Concerns when taking creating supplements for people who have already high blood pressure. "Dr. Sonpal explains why creatine and blood pressure don't mix in some people: "Creatine makes your kidneys work harder, so there is a risk that it may cause your blood pressure to rise and/or worsen. The data is still conflicting as to a true link." But, to be safe, he says, "the best thing to do is avoid this supplement if you have hypertension.""[3]
- "These results suggest that long-term creatine supplementation (up to 4-8 weeks) may adversely affect kidney and liver structure and function of sedentary but not of exercised rats." [26]
- Concerns about kidneys because of creatinine, though for now it seems that creatinine remains at safe levels [4]
- Should increase water intake to avoid issues with kidneys. (Sources required)
- Does not improve endurance [17]
- Potential very rare cases of acute liver failure [19]. 

# Posology
- 5g per day [17]
- Beta-alanine can improve creatine [39]
