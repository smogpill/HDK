Also known as Collagen Peptides

# Posology
- Important that the supplement states that the collagen is either "peptides" or "hydrolyzed" (both being the same thing) or else the molecules would be too big for absorption. [1]
- "I take 15 g a day and I mix it into my smoothie. " - Brad Stanfield [1]

# Pros
