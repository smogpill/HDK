Also known as Collagen Peptides

# Posology
- Important that the supplement states that the collagen is either "peptides" or "hydrolyzed" (both being the same thing) or else the molecules would be too big for absorption. [1]
- "I take 15 g a day and I mix it into my smoothie. " - Brad Stanfield [1][6]
- Should be taken at room temperature because heat destroys collagen [9]
- Type 1 or type 2 doesn't matter [13]

# Pros
- Improvements on wrinkles [1][6]
- Improvements on skin moisture, elasticity, dryness and the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS) [6]
- Improved tendons strength [1]
- Collagen-based supplement shows significantly higher wound healing rates over just proteins (soy) [1][6]

# Misc
- Effects can take weeks or months [13]
