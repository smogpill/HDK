# Also known as
- Trimethylglycine
- Betaine
- Betaine anhydrous

# Pros
- Might reduce the side effects of niacin on methyl pools [1]
- "You do need enough folate and B12 for for the different cycles, so youâ€™ve got the folate cycle, for example. In terms of actually giving your body methyl groups, TMG is a very efficient way of doing it." - Dr Brad Stanfield [1]
- Can help exercise (resistance and power training) [2]
- Might help lowering homocysteine and so help against dementia [2][3][5][14]
- Improves muscle performance by delaying fatigue in high intensity activities [3][5][10][13]
- May enhance muscle building [3]
- Increases testosterone levels [5][10][12]

# Cons
- Dr Stanfield takes only 1g per day because there is no safety data for long term [2]
- Benefits happen when TMG is paired with exercise [3]

# Posology
- 1g per day [3]
