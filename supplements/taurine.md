# Pros
- Taurine protects the brain, heart, eyes, and muscles from damage and stress. [7]
- It may help guard against obesity, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. [8]
- Both magnesium and taurine decrease calcium and sodium levels in the body's cells. [9]
- They've both been shown to lower blood pressure and help prevent arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) and blood clots. [10]
